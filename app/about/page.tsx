            <p className="lg:max-w-[25%] max-w-[80%] text-wrap">Hi! My name is Filip Kober and I&apos;m a{n && "n"} {myAge} year old software developer from Poland ðŸ‡µðŸ‡±</p>

            <p className="lg:max-w-[25%] max-w-[80%] text-wrap">
                It&apos;s my own little place on the internet, where I upload whatever I feel like uploading. <br/>
                For a really long time I wanted to have a spot like this, and I finally have my place.
                This website not only serves as my portfolio, but also as a place where I will just make stuff that I find
                cool and upload it here

            <h2 className="mt-8 text-4xl mb-8">Programming</h2>
            <p className="lg:max-w-[25%] max-w-[80%] text-wrap">
                My journey with programming began pretty early on. I don&apos;t remember exactly how old I was,
                but it was around the age of 12. My journey started pretty unusual, as my first experience with coding
                was making scripts (basically cheats) for Roblox games. Doing that I learned Lua and basics of reverse engineering <br /><br />
                After doing this for a bit, I moved onto web technologies. I fell in love with making websites and APIs.
                I&apos;m not good at web design (or design in general), so I tend to like the backend side more, however I find frontend enjoyable too. <br/><br/>
                I like a bunch of branches of programming. I have the most skill in web, however I also really like game development, AI and making simulations.
